    "text": "Welcome to the Data Analytics in Finance course materials. This website contains all the lecture slides, assignments, and resources for the course.\n\n\nThis course is designed to equip students with comprehensive data analysis skills using Stata and a thorough understanding of research methods in finance. The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation of econometric techniques essential for empirical finance research.\nStudents will learn how to apply statistical analysis techniques with proper understanding of underlying assumptions, interpret data effectively, and address common methodological challenges in financial research. These skills directly support students’ ability to successfully complete their master thesis replication projects and prepare them for data-intensive roles in the financial industry.\n\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nData Management: Clean, transform, and merge complex datasets using different identifiers (CUSIP, GVKEY, PERMNO) in Stata\nEconometric Theory: Understand and verify the assumptions underlying statistical methods used in finance research\nPanel Methods: Implement and interpret fixed effects models with appropriate standard error corrections\nCausal Inference: Apply difference-in-differences, event studies, and instrumental variables with proper identification strategies\nResearch Communication: Create publication-quality tables and essential visualizations for academic papers\nReplication Skills: Execute replications of published research with proper documentation and Stata code\n\n\n\n\nThe course consists of 6 sessions, each lasting 2 hours 45 minutes. The sessions will be held in person on campus. The course includes individual assignments that reinforce the concepts learned in class.\n\n\n\n\nData Management and Merging\nData Exploration and Academic Tables\nRegression Methods and Identification\nPanel Data Methods (with DiD)\nEvent Studies (CAR) and Fama–MacBeth\nReplication Workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular practice exercises will be posted here throughout the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix assignments throughout the course\nAll assignments must be completed\n\n\n\n\nTBD\n\n\n\n\nOverall course grade ≥ 55%\nReplication exercise grade ≥ 50%\nAll assignments must be submitted\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents will use:\n\nStata (version 17 or higher) - All econometric analysis\nAccess to financial databases through university subscriptions\n\nAll software is available through university resources.
